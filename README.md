I do not own most of the content used in this project like: 
* Images 

I do not earn money from this and the only purpose of it was to complete the corresponding course.

## How to use
It´s an invetory where you can manage your own workers, with names and roles in the company, with the ability of adding, deleting or 
updating the workers. It´s suppose to work with MySQL local only, it won´t work if someone tries to use it for online matters.

## Compatibility 
This game was developed to run in Chrome navigator, it may run in other navigators such as Firefox or Edge, but it´s not recommend it.

## Credit
You have all rights to use it as you wish, but I will be so grateful if you credit me for my hard work. Have fun!
